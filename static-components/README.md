# Static Components
## Why? 
- Docusaurus only allows stringified html to be injected into the theme based components.
- This allows for more robust customization without re-writing things like the navbar or the footer.
- Also allows for cleaner writing of css and html with interpolation and re-use of components.
- see SocialsBox for example.
