# User Guide

Experience just how easy it is to go from zero to chainsaw-wielding hero (of the Kubernetes cluster) using Zarf!

- Deploy Zarf [Packages](2-zarf-packages/1-zarf-packages.md) (Zpkg)
- Maintain Zarf Packages in the cluster
- A reference of all [CLI commands](1-the-zarf-cli/100-cli-commands/0-zarf.md)
- Autogenerate and view a package SBOM
- Add logging to your cluster
- A list of [supported Zarf packages](2-zarf-packages/1-zarf-packages.md)
