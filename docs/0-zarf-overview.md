## What is Zarf?

Zarf is an open-source tool that simplifies the setup & deployment of applications and resources onto AirGap or disconnected environments. You can think of a disconnected environment as a system that has the has limited connection to the internet, kind of like airplane mode.

Zarf equips you with the ability to quickly and securely deploy modern software onto these types of systems without relying on internet connectivity. It also simplifies the installation, updating, and maintenance of DevSecOps capabilities like Kubernetes clusters, logging, and SBOM compliance out of the box. Most importantly Zarf keeps applications and systems running even when they are disconnected.

## How Zarf works?

Zarf uses a static Go binary CLI that can be run on any machine, with or without internet connectivity. The Zarf CLI equips users with the ability to pull, package, and install all the resources their applications or clusters need to run without being connected to the internet. It can also deploy any necessary resources needed to stand up infrastructure tools (such as Terraform).

All that is needed to deploy your infrastructure, application, and resources in a disconnected environment is 3 files; the Zarf CLI binary, the Zarf init package, and a Zarf Package containing your app and resources.
